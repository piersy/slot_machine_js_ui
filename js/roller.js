    The default approach taken by fragment identifiers to mapping the viewbox to
    the viewport(the img tag) is that the viewbox center will be aligned with the
    viewport center, and it will be scaled maintaining its aspect ratio such that
    it fills the viewport as far as it can without extending any edges past the
    viewport. At that point any edges not at the extent of the viewport will be
    extended to touch the viewport edges. This means if we have defined a square
    viewbox that we put in a rectangular viewport we will see a rectangular
    section of the svg.
    
    The original kitty viewbox is (0,0,3000,3000) with quite a lot of empty space
    around the kitty so we want to cut about 500 off each edge. We also want to
    ensure that each image slice fills the viewport fully vertically, this ensures
    that segments will align. We are not bothered about the horizontal aspect of our
    viewbox as long as it is centered. By setting the width to be very small and
    setting the left offset to the center of the image we ensure that the viewport
    is fully vertically filled and leave it up to the SVG system to extend the
    viewbox to the horizontal segment edges.
